# Intercellar Technical Test

## Front-end developer test
Welcome to the technical test for front-end developer. The test isn't hard, if you have knowledge in web3 and interaction with smart contracts then you will succeed without problem. If not, then the test is still feasible with a little research. Our goal is to find someone passionate, able of self-adapting and who is curious to try.

### Instructions
I deployed a smart-contract to Polygon testnet "Amoy" at this address : 
`0x5f100C3e6f8fA7e4E76918dCad61c3B6f65709A3`

The source code of the contract is available in the repo in the "contract" folder.
It's a simple Counter smart-contract on which there is a counter variable and 5 functions. These functions that allow you to increase or reduce the counter. You have to build a React (typescript only) application who interact with the smart-contract, you have to use [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) for it. On the application you have to display counter value in real time and the possibility to the user to increase or reduce it. We don't care about the design, just the minimum and the basis of responsive.

When you finish, send the github link of your app to this email : lucas.pereira@intercellar.io
